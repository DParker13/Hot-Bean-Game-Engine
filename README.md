# Hot Bean Engine

A 2D video game engine built using C++ and SDL2.

The Hot Bean Engine (Name Pending) is a personal project I've been working on to teach myself C++. This project is aimed at creating a lightweight and flexible game engine for 2D games. The engine is designed to be easy to use and extend, with a focus on performance and compatibility.

Based on Austin Morlan's simple ECS design from his blog post at https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/
