High Priority
- Create concept of Game systems and Scene Systems?
- Make RenderManager into RenderService where it is used as a staging area and then the RenderSystem is the one actually in charge of presenting the changes to screen.
- Create TransformManager to wrap TransformSystem so it can be used by the editor
- Create AudioManager
- Create OnInit() in IGameLoop. OnStart will only be called when the application is started/playing,
so it can be called multiple times in editor mode
- Add single camera in editor mode
    + Add visible viewport for camera entities in editor mode
    + Disable/Modify clipping in editor mode
    + Add events to handle input and entity selection/manipulation in editor mode
    + Add modes to game_loop_manager (Rename this to application_state_manager?)
    + Make input system more generic to be used in editor_gui and in-game
- Create Editor System
    + Integrate ImGUI for interactable debug menu!
- Finish default systems!!
    + Rendering system
        ~ Fix culling for multicamera
        ~ Add scaling based on camera
    + Collision System
        ~ Separate from Physics System
    + Physics System
        ~ Add more shapes
        ~ Separate into Collision System
    + Input System
        ~ Think of way to make key functions configurable
    + UI System
        ~ Add buttons
        ~ Add textboxes
- Create interfaces for system events
    + Can be used to create Event System events like OnMouseDown, OnMouseUp, OnClick, etc
    + Can be used to create Collision System events like OnEnter,
- Create interface for systems that allow for entities to be initialized once they're added to a system
    + Like Unity Start()
    + I created OnEntityAdded, but this is called when the entity's signature matches a system, which
        usually happens before any values are initialized for the components
- UI Elements need to use relative positions
    + Absolute positions won't work for resizing or transferring ui data between machines
    + Example: Button located at {50, 50} to be "centered" in the screen
- Improve error handling
    + utilize SDL_Error()
    + Create custom errors for easier debugging
    + Remove exceptions
- Fix copying of files from source to binary directory
    + Files are only copied once
    + Any changed files are not copied
- Create textured sprite class
    + Used SDLImage to load and display images from file
- Create smarter text system
    + Add font size control
    + Add support for multiple fonts
    + Clean up logic
    + Separate Font pointer from Text component?
- Create better way to register systems in whatever order the user wants
    + Add ability to re-order systems in editor mode
- Add easy way to multithread each System function
- Create an Application Layering system?
    + Move editor system here
    + Create game layer

Medium Priority
- Can modify components in realtime without recompiling
    + Add debugging capabilities to select an entity by clicking and a menu will popup with each component
- Create basic ui library
- Add animation system
- Add ability to register systems to its own thread
- Create fancy workflow flowcharts for documentation
- Use Vulcan with SDL3?

Low Priority
- Add second buffer (next frame) to Rendering System
- Move rendering step to its own thread
    + This might not be possible in SDL2
- Add image to EXE
- Add splashscreen
- Create settings menu
- Change system manager to use something other than bitset for signature (allows for more registered components)
- Modify system manager to register with Archetypes?
    + Need to create a generic archetype interface
        ~ GetComponentNames
    + Iterate through all components associated with Archetype to set signature!
- Create a script component (not sure how to do this. Use C# for scripts?)

Next Version?
- Modify engine to handle 3D objects
    + Camera system would need to be reworked
    + New Transform3D component
- Add multiplayer/server


Ideas/Concerns:
- Should components have functionality tied to them, or should helper classes be used?
- Add ability to create archetype with any number of default components instead of needing all at once. Any "missing" components will be added with default values
- When this is created, OnEntityAdded is called for each system and the defaults are used instead. Check if there are issues with this approach with transforms.
